    "# SIATEC Patterns and Tune Families in The Session\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will run one of the best-known musical pattern extraction algorithms on tunes from *The Session*, and implement a simple method for the task of tune family detection (similar to the task of cover-song detection).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As already described (Polifonia deliverables D3.1-D3.6, 2021-2024; Danny Diamond MSc thesis, 2024), the concept of tune families is an important one in the musicology of traditional music, and we have developed methods of automatically detecting tune families based on several types of $n$-gram melodic patterns. The goal of this notebook is to implement another method, based on a totally different definition of melodic patterns. As we will see, this method does not work well -- not because of a weakness in the algorithms or the patterns, but because this new definition of pattern has a different goal -- *compression* rather than *linking*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SIATEC patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "SIATEC, COSIATEC, and SIATECCompress are members of a family of pattern-extraction algorithms developed by David Meredith in multiple papers over several years. A representative paper is: [*COSIATEC and SIATECCompress:\n",
    "Pattern discovery by geometric compression*](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/publications/094ac3cf-78ca-4f87-8c6a-77303e3b1d36), David Meredith, Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms work on *point-set* data, ie music where each note is represented only by an onset time (in beats, or MIDI ticks, or another unit) and a pitch (chromatic or diatonic). The algorithms work by detecting subsets of the data which occur more than once. They aim to extract the best subsets, which occur most often, using heuristics such as \"compactness\" of the pattern, to help. When detected, the pattern is removed from the dataset, and each repetition is replaced by a reference. Each repetition that is detected and encoded in such an extracted pattern thus allows the original dataset to be compressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus in this notebook on the SIATECCompress algorithm, which allows patterns to overlap with each other. This choice is primarily because it is faster (Meredith, 2013) and our corpus is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implemention we use is `OMNISIA.jar`, from: http://www.titanmusic.com/software.php. We are grateful to David Meredith for providing a high-quality implementation."

    "\n",
    "`.\\abc2midi.exe thesession.abc -silent -NGRA -NCOM`\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives a `.mid` file for each tune in the `.abc` - approximately 40,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then run the SIATEC algorithm on each MIDI file as follows. We have a function to run the algorithm once for a single MIDI file and a function to loop over all MIDI files, and a function to parse the output of a single run to a new .pat file."

    "Meredith (2013) writes:\n",
    "\"Both algorithms [COSIATEC and SIATECCompress] are founded on the hypothesis that the\n",
    "best ways of understanding a piece of music are those that\n",
    "are represented by the shortest descriptions of the piece. In\n",
    "other words, they are designed to explore the notion that\n",
    "music analysis is effectively just music compression.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis is central to my (McDermott) view of music analysis also. I look to papers such as Schmidhuber's *Low-Complexity Art*. In related work (working with Maziar Kanani and Seán O'Leary, not part of the Polifonia project), I use the *Assembly Pathway* (Cronin and colleagues) and the *Sequitur* algorithm (Nevil-Manning and Witten).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it seems that a compression approach is not necessarily well-suited to the task of *linking pieces of music*. This difference in goals likely explains the unexpected results.\n"
