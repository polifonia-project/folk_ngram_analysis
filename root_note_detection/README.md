# Root Note Detection

The files in this folder are related to the Root note detection task. The notebook exploits monophonic Irish folk tunes processed data (that can be found in ```cre_root_detection.csv``` file) and with help of machine learning models predicts the root note of a tune. Determination of the root note of each piece of music in the corpus under investigation is a key foundational step in FONN. Accurate root note data allows reliable calculation of key-invariant chromatic pitch class sequences, which have been the primary input for our pattern analysis and melodic similarity work.

NOTE: Deliverable 3.3 of the Polifonia project describes the context and research in more detail.

To use the best trained model for root-note prediction tasks, follow the **demo notebook** [./RootNoteDemo.ipynb](https://github.com/polifonia-project/folk_ngram_analysis/blob/master/root_note_detection/RootNoteDemo.ipynb).


### Prerequisites
This component requires the ```cre_root_detection.csv```. This file contains the processed data for each tune in the Ceol Rince na hÉireann (CRE) corpus. please see: [/.root_key_detection/cre_root_detection.csv](https://github.com/polifonia-project/folk_ngram_analysis/blob/master/root_note_detection/cre_root_detection.csv)


In this deliverable, we employed a factorial design experiment for Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes algorithms. We used a comprehensive list of hyperparameters to select the top-performing models. We also conducted experiments using SMOTE to generate a synthetic balance dataset. Finally, evaluation was done on an unseen dataset, and the obtained results are superior to state-of-the-art models. 

Following is the summary of the current work. The **experiment notebook** [./root-note-detection.ipynb](https://github.com/polifonia-project/folk_ngram_analysis/blob/master/root_note_detection/root-note-detection.ipynb) reads the Ceol Rince na hÉireann (CRE) corpus CSV file and then performs the following steps:

* 1- Exploratory Data Analysis, such as null value, classes count, correlations, etc. 
* 2- Global settings are defined to control feature selection
* 3- Multiple dataset are created for model development and its evaluation
* 4- Minority classes are balanced with help of SMOTE
* 5- Classification report of state-of-the-art models for root note detection are generated for comparison
* 6- Factorial design experimental setup is developed to evaluate different classification algorithms such as  Decision Tree, RandomForest, NaiveBayes 
* 7- The best models are selected, and finally they are compared with SOA models, and the best model is saved.

The **demo notebook** [./RootNoteDemo.ipynb](https://github.com/polifonia-project/folk_ngram_analysis/blob/master/root_note_detection/RootNoteDemo.ipynb) shows how to use the best trained model for new prediction tasks.
